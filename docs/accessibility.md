# Accessibility

The DQT [Web Portals](https://teacherservices.education.gov.uk/) do not do enough to meet Government web accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1). The accessibility notice highlights where the pages do not meet a satisfactory benchmark.

An internal assessment was carried out in July 2020 which rated the Portals as meeting the standard, but this is incorrect.

The TRA Digital team will look to redevelop these Portals (or those that continue to meet user needs) and make them at least AA accessible.

Accessibility will be validated by the likes of the [Digital Accessibility Centre.](https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/)
