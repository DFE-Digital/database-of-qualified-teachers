# Business and Service Continuity

### Azure Back-up

Azure Production VMâ€™s are backed up weekly via Microsoft Azure backup. Azure Backup copies and archives all computer data, including the machine configuration, so that, in collaboration with the service Application Support Provider (ASP), restore of the VM is semi-automated and accelerated in the event of machine loss.

### Database Level Backups:

DfE Infrastructure Ops routinely monitors all backup reports for success. By default, Azure backup data is stored three times redundantly within different fault domains in the same region to increase resilience. It is not geo-replicated.

Required authorisation to start the restore procedure should be obtained from the Business Owner.
