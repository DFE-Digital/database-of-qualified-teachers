# 003 - Build Find a Lost TRN Service

**Date: 06-05-2022**

## Status

**Accepted**

## Context
In order to reduce TRA contact centre calls and enable citizens (who have a TRN - Teacher Reference Number), an easy way to find their TRN.

## Decision
We will build a Ruby on Rails Monolith web site on GOV.UK to GDS standards.

## Consequences
Calls to the Ð¢RA Helpdesk will reduce.
Better user experience, as the service will be very quick and simple to use.
