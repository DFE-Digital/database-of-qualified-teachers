Build Find a Lost TRN Servivce
Accepted 06/05/2022


Context
In order to reduce TRA contact centre calls and enable citezens (who have a TRN - Teacher Reference Number), an easy way to find their TRN.

Decision
We will build a Ruby on Rails Monolith web site on Gov.uk to GDS standards.

Consequences
Calls to the TRN will reduce.
Better user experience, as the service will be very quick and simple to use.
