# TRA Service Descriptions

The Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) is an arms-length body of the DfE that:

* Confirms [Qualified Teacher Status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/qualified-teacher-status-qts) to appropriately qualified English and international teachers

* Provides an [employment checking service](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/teacher-status-checks-information-for-employers) to support employers of teachers to fulfil their statutory and safeguarding responsibilities

* Operates the [regulatory system for teacher misconduct](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/teacher-misconduct) on behalf of the Secretary of State.

To deliver some of these responsibilities, the TRA manages a number of systems and services. The Teacher Qualification Unit within the TRA is primarily responsible for creating and maintaining the teacher records, awarding QTS and providing information from the database to authorised individuals and organisations. 

The services and systems include:

* The [TRA web portals](https://teacherservices.education.gov.uk/) consist of six user interfaces that are accessed externally by teachers and schools/employers and training providers to view and/or provide details of teachers, their qualifications and eligibility.

* [Qualified Teachers API](https://teacher-services-tech-docs.london.cloudapps.digital/#qualified-teachers-api) Provides partners with an API to securely access and share data with the TRA.

* [Find a Lost Teacher Reference Number (TRN)](https://find-a-lost-trn.education.gov.uk/start) is a public facing digital service that allows anyone to find their TRN without calling the Teacher Regulation Agency help desk.

* [Apply For QTS](https://apply-for-qts-in-england.education.gov.uk/eligibility/start) is a public facing digital service that allows Teachers from outside the UK to apply for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).
