# Security and IT governance

All services should have an annual IT Health Check (ITHC) to maintain a current Authority to Operate (AtO).

The Business Owner (SRO) is responsible for ensuring an annual ITHC is undertaken, either using internal security colleagues, or via an approved 3rd party such as BSI. The Technology Directorate Service Manager, Andy Charlesworth, shall support the service through the ITHC and assist with facilitating the remediation of any risks identified.

As TRA systems and services have historically been disparate, AtO details are as follows:

## DQT

| Dates                                       |     |
| ------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Date of last IT health check                |     |
| Date of Authority to operate                |     |
| Duration of Authority to Operate (security) |     |

## New TRA API

| Dates                                       |     |
