# Database of Qualified Teachers DfE Teacher Regulation Agency

This is a "general" repo for Database of Qualified Teachers (DQT) documentation and service components. The "DQT" is being transformed into discreet digital services. As a result large parts of the technical architecture are changing and the code base being re-factored and in many cases split into the relevant concerns. This means that there are a growing number of repo's that represent the individual digital services that represent the transformed TRA Digital Service suite. Please check below link for a full view of these repo's...
